# Graphs

A __graph__ consists of __vertices__ (nodes) connected by __edges__ (arcs).

The two main categories of graphs are __undirected__ graphs, in which edges don't have any particular direction, and __directed graphs__, where edges have direction - for example, there may be an edge from node A to node B, but no edge from node B to node A.

Generally, we use the following notation for a graph $G$: $n$ is the number of vertices, i.e. $|V|$, $m$ is the number of edges, i.e. $|E|$.

Within undirected graphs there are other distinctions:

- a _simple_ graph is a graph in which there are no loops and only single edges are allowed
- a _regular_ graph is one in which each vertex has the same number of neighbors (i.e. the same degree)
- a _complete_ graph is a simple graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge
- a _connected_ graph is a graph where there exists a path between every pair of vertices

For a connected graph with no parallel edges (i.e. each pair of vertices has only zero or one edge between it), $m$ is somewhere between $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n^2)$.

Generally, a graph is said to be __sparse__ if $m$ is $O(n)$ or close to it (that is, it has the lower end of number of edges). If $m$ is closer to $O(n^2)$, this is generally said to be a __dense__ graph.

An adjacency matrix requires $\Theta(n^2)$ space. If the graph is sparse, this is a waste of space, and an adjacency list is more appropriate - you have an array of vertices and an array of edges. Each edge points to its endpoints, and each vertex points to edges incident on it. This requires $\Theta(m+n)$ space (because the array of vertices takes $\Theta(n)$ space and the arrays of edges, edge-to-endpoints, and vertex-to-edges each take $\Theta(m)$, for $\Theta(n+3m) = \Theta(m+n)$), so it is better for sparse graphs.

Consider the accompanying example graph.

![Example graph](assets/graph_example.svg)

A __path__ $A \to B$ is the sequence of nodes connecting $A$ to $B$, including $A$ and $B$.

Here the path $A \to B$ is $A,C,E,B$.

$A,C,E$ are the __ancestors__ of $B$.
$C,E,B$ are the __descendants__ of $A$.

![Example of a cyclic graph](assets/graph_cycle_example.svg)

A __cycle__ is a directed path which ends where it starts. Here, $A,D,C,B$ form a cycle.

A __loop__ is any path (directed or not) which ends where it starts.

A graph with no cycles is said to be __acyclic__.

A __chord__ is any edge which connects two non-adjacent nodes in a loop.

__Directed acyclic graphs__ (DAGs) are used often. In a DAG, __parents__ are the nodes which point to a given node; the nodes that a given node points to are its __children__. A __family__ of a node is the node and its parents.

The __Markov blanket__ of a node is its parents, children, and the parents of its children (including itself).

For an undirected graph, a node's __neighbors__ are noes directly connected to it.

In an undirected graph, a __clique__ is a fully-connected subset of nodes. All members of a clique are neighbors.

A __maximal clique__ is a clique which is not a subset of another clique.

![A graph demonstrating cliques](assets/clique_example.svg)

In this graph:

- $\{A,B,C,D\}$ is a maximal clique
- $\{B,C,E\}$ is a maximal clique
- $\{A,B,C\}$ is a non-maximal clique, contained in $\{A,B,C,D\}$

An undirected graph is __connected__ if there is a path between every pair of nodes. That is, there is no isolated subgraph.

For a non-connected graph, its __connected components__ are its subgraphs which are connected.

A __singly connected graph__ is the connected graph (directed or not) where there is only one path between each pair of nodes. This is equivalent to a __tree__.

A non-singly connected graph is said to be __multiply connected__.

A __spanning tree__ of an undirected graph is one where the sum of all edge weights is at least as large as any other spanning trees'.

Graphs can be represented as an __adjacency matrix__:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where a non-zero value at $A_{ij}$ indicates that node $i$ is connected to node $j$.

A __clique matrix__ represents the maximal cliques in a graph.

For example, this clique matrix describes the following maximal clique:

$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

A clique matrix containing only 2-node cliques is an __incidence matrix__:

$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
