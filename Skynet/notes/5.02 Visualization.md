## Bivariate charts

__Bivariate charts__ display information about the relationship between _two_ variables. This includes scatterplots and line graphs.

## Histograms

When you have continuous data, you can get a sense of the data's density around values using a __histogram__. A histogram breaks your data up into __bins__, so that values falling within each bin are grouped together. Then the number of values (i.e. the frequency of values) in each bin is plotted out like a bar chart. This helps provide a sense of how the data is distributed.

## Scatterplots

__Scatterplots__ plot out each individual data point (according to two dimensions) and can provide intuitions into correlation of the plotted dimensions, amongst other things.
