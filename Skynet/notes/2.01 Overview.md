# Overview

## Representation vs Learning:

- Representation: whether or not a function can be simulated by the model; i.e. is the model capable of _representing_ a given function?
- Learning: whether or not their exists an algorithm with which the weights can be adjusted to represent a particular function

## Types of learning

- __supervised learning__ - the learning algorithm is provided with pre-labeled _training_ examples to learn from.
- __unsupervised learning__ - the learning algorithm is provided with unlabeled examples. Generally, unsupervised learning is used to uncover some structure of or pattern in the data.
- __semi-supervised learning__ - the learning algorithm is provided with a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data.
- __active learning__ - similar to semi-supervised learning, but the algorithm can "ask" for extra labeled data based on what it needs to improve on.
- __reinforcement learning__ - actions are taken and rewarded or penalized in some way and the goal is maximizing lifetime/long-term reward (or minimizing lifetime/long-term penalty).
